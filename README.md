This pipeline is to compute Reverse Gene Expression Score (RGES) published by Chen B. et al (Nature Communications, 2017). In this work, we found that the drug's ability to reverse cancer gene expression (RGES) correlates to its efficacy (IC50) in cancer cell lines.

To run the code, you need to first download data from https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn6182429/files/

and then run workflow.R. We recommend to run it line by line.
